# Assembly and Embedded Systems

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Goal

This project focuses on using **ARM assembly language** to develop and integrate three core functions:
- `name`: print team members
- `id`: read and sum student IDs
- `drawJuliaSet`: render the Julia Set fractal using ARM assembly

The `main.c` function in C integrates these assembly routines, resulting in a complete program that:
1. Displays team info.
2. Accepts user input for student IDs.
3. Draws the Julia Set pattern in console.
