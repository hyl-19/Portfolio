# Data Structures and Algorithms

A collection of C++ implementations for fundamental data structures and algorithms, designed for instructional use in a Data Structures and Algorithms course. Each module provides clean, well-documented code and sample usage to facilitate learning and experimentation.

---

## Overview

This repository covers:

* **Trees**: Binary search trees, 2-3 trees, search utilities
* **Heaps**: Min-heap, min-max heap implementations
* **Hash Tables**: Quadratic probing and double hashing
* **Graphs**: Adjacency list construction, BFS/DFS, shortest paths

Each module reads input from formatted files or generates sample data, then performs key operations (insert, delete, search, traverse).
